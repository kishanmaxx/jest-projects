# Learning End-to-End Testing with Jest
This is the repository for the LinkedIn Learning course Learning End-to-End Testing with Jest.

Testing small parts of an application is fairly easy, but as you assemble systems, the test complexity often grows with the number of interconnected systems. Sometimes, rather than testing just the parts, you want to test the whole process, as one large set. In this course, Chinyelu Ibute shows you how the JavaScript testing framework, Jest, lets you create comprehensive tests so you can verify the functionality of your entire application. Chinyelu starts with the basics of the test-driven development, including the different types. She then shows how to write an end-to-end test for a RESTful web-service application built with Node.js and MongoDB using Jest. Finally, she explains how to test the application workflow from beginning to end, with a high code coverage.
